You'll need to have downloaded and installed the following:
* VirtualBox
* Vagrant

For additional dependencies and setup see the Install section below.

# Install

I highly recommend you look at the [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) for managing your 
account's Ruby environment a manor which is as sane as possible. Assuming you have either rbenv or
rvm installed:

```bash
$ gem install bundler
$ bundle
```
To check whether or not your system has all of the dependencies necessary to run the Vagrant environments:

```bash
$ rake deps
Checking environment dependencies...
...
Congratulations! Everything looks a-ok.
```

If the above step fails, unless the output tells you to do something differently, I recommend running:

```bash
$ sudo rake setup
$ rake deps
```

# Usage
To start up the environment: 

```bash
$ rake modules
$ vagrant up 
```
